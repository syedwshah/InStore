# Installation in managed Expo projects

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
expo install expo-facebook
```

### Configure for iOS

Run `pod install` in the ios directory after installing the npm package.

### Configure for Android

No additional set up necessary.

In `AndroidManifest.xml`, add the following element within your `<application>` element:

```xml
...
      <!-- The Facebook SDK runs FacebookInitProvider on startup and crashes if there isn't an ID here -->
    <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="fb0"/>
  </application>
```
